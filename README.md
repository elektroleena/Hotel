# Hotel
This is a project I worked on as part of my studies at FH Technikum Wien together with my fellow student Helene Harrer.
It is a website for an imaginary hotel we came up with, where it is possible to create an account in order to book hotel rooms.
For admins, it is possible to administer all users and bookings as well as posting news on the news page.
